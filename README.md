There are many ways that I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure. My new favorite, and the way I learned in this course, is automated testing. Automated testing is a method of testing in which I use a tool such as JUnit test to perform unit tests on my code. Using JUnit test allows me a way to easily test different parts of my code all at the same time as well as outlines hyperlinks to certain indexes in my code which I can review. Interpereting user needs is arguably one of the most important skills to have as a developer. Developers can use a variety of methods to help document the needs of a user including methods such as users stories. This is a way of seperating different user needs and even putting them in order of priority. Designing software can be done in a multitude of ways but my personal go to is laying out and extensive plan before diving head first into the coding aspect. This may not be the way I complete every project but it is the method that I find works the best. Pseudocode is one thing that I would recommend to any beginners as well as senior developers.
